# Flip 7 - Game Rules

Flip 7 is a press-your-luck card game designed by Eric Olsen for 3+ players, ages 8 and up. Games typically last around 20 minutes.

## Objective

Be the first player to score **200 or more points**. If multiple players exceed 200 points in the same round, the player with the highest score wins.

## The Deck (94 Cards)

### Number Cards (78 cards)

The deck contains number cards from 0 to 12. The quantity of each card matches its value:

| Card | Quantity | Points |
|------|----------|--------|
| 0    | 1        | 0      |
| 1    | 1        | 1      |
| 2    | 2        | 2      |
| 3    | 3        | 3      |
| 4    | 4        | 4      |
| 5    | 5        | 5      |
| 6    | 6        | 6      |
| 7    | 7        | 7      |
| 8    | 8        | 8      |
| 9    | 9        | 9      |
| 10   | 10       | 10     |
| 11   | 11       | 11     |
| 12   | 12       | 12     |

### Action Cards

- **Freeze** - Immediately banks your points and ends your turn for the round
- **Flip Three** - Draw 3 additional cards from the deck (normal rules apply - you can still bust)
- **Second Chance** - Your safety net! Use it to discard a duplicate number card and continue playing. You can only have one Second Chance card at a time; extras must be given to another player or discarded.

### Modifier Cards

- **+2 to +10** - Adds bonus points to your score at the end of the round
- **X2** - Doubles the total of all your number cards (applied before adding other modifiers)

## Setup

1. Shuffle all 94 cards to form a central draw pile
2. Choose a dealer (this role rotates clockwise after each round)
3. The dealer deals **one card face-up** to each player, including themselves
4. If any action cards are dealt during setup, resolve them immediately before continuing

## Gameplay

Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, each player takes a turn. On your turn, you must choose one of two actions:

### Hit (Draw a Card)

Flip the top card of the deck and add it to your tableau:

- **Number Card**: Place it face-up in front of you
  - If it's a **duplicate** of a number you already have, you **BUST!** (score 0 this round)
  - If it's your **7th unique number**, you automatically stop and score your cards plus a **15-point bonus**
- **Action Card**: Resolve its effect immediately
- **Modifier Card**: Place it in your tableau; it will add to your score if you don't bust

### Pass (Stay)

Stop drawing cards and bank your current points. You're done for the round but keep your score.

## Busting

You bust **only** when you draw a duplicate number card. Action cards and Modifier cards **cannot** cause you to bust.

When you bust:
- You score **0 points** for the round
- All your cards are discarded
- Your turn ends

## Scoring

At the end of a round, players who didn't bust calculate their scores:

1. **Add up all number card values**
2. **Apply X2 multiplier** (if you have one) - doubles your number card total
3. **Add modifier bonuses** (+2 to +10)
4. **Add Flip 7 bonus** (+15 points if you have 7 unique number cards)

### Example

You have: 3, 7, 10, 12, +5 modifier, X2 modifier

1. Number cards: 3 + 7 + 10 + 12 = 32
2. Apply X2: 32 × 2 = 64
3. Add +5 modifier: 64 + 5 = **69 points**

## End of Round

The round ends when all players have either:
- Passed (banked their points)
- Busted (scored 0)
- Been frozen (by Freeze card)
- Achieved Flip 7 (7 unique numbers)

The dealer role passes clockwise, and a new round begins.

## End of Game

The game ends when at least one player reaches **200 or more points** at the end of a round. The player with the highest total score wins!
