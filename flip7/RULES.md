# Flip 7 Official Rules (Ruleset Edition 3.1)

A game by Eric Olsen | 3+ Players | Ages 8+ | ~20 minutes

## Objective

Be the first player to score **200 points**. You score points based on the total number value of the cards in front of you.

- The more valuable a card is, the more copies of that card exist in the deck
- If you successfully flip 7 unique Number cards, you end the round immediately and score a **15-point bonus**
- If you draw a duplicate number, you **bust** and score nothing for the round

## How to Play

### Setup

1. Have pen and paper ready to track scores
2. Shuffle the deck **thoroughly**
3. Choose a player to be the Dealer for the round

### Dealing

The Dealer deals one card face-up to each player in turn order (including themselves).

**Important**: If an Action card comes up during dealing, pause dealing immediately to resolve it. Once resolved, continue dealing until everyone has been dealt a card.

> Not everyone will have a Number card at this point. Some players may have a Number or Modifier card, but others may have no cards or even three or four cards depending on what Action cards are dealt.

### Player Turns

The Dealer offers each player in turn the option to:

- **"Hit"** - Get dealt another card
- **"Stay"** - Exit the round and bank your points

If you Hit, arrange your Number cards in a single row with Score Modifier cards above them.

You may "Stay" as long as you have at least one card in front of you.

### Busting

If you draw a Number card with the same value as one already in your line, you **bust** and are out of the round, scoring nothing.

## The Action Cards

Action cards can be played on **any active player** including yourself. If you are the only active player in the round, you **must** play the Action card on yourself. Set these cards above your Number cards.

> **What is an active player?** If you haven't Busted or decided to Stay, you're an active player!

### Freeze

The player receiving this card banks all the points they have collected and is out of the round.

### Flip Three

The player who receives this card must accept the next three cards, flipping them one at a time.

- All number cards, action cards, and modifier cards count toward the three cards needed
- Stop early if the player achieves Flip 7 or busts
- If a Second Chance card is revealed, it may be set aside and used
- If another Flip Three or Freeze card is revealed, they are resolved **AFTER** all three cards are drawn (but only if the player hasn't busted)

### Second Chance

**Keep this card.** If the player with this card draws another card with the same number as one they already have:

- Discard both the Second Chance card and the duplicate number card
- The player does NOT bust

**Additional Second Chance rules:**

- A player may only have one Second Chance card at a time
- If dealt another Second Chance while already having one, give it to another active player
- If no other active players exist (or all have one), discard the Second Chance card
- All Second Chance cards are discarded at the end of a round, even if never used

## The Modifier Cards

Modifiers are **not** Number cards and do **not** count toward achieving a Flip 7.

You cannot bust on Modifier cards. You can end your turn with just a Modifier card and no number cards, and you would still score those points (unless it's a x2 card).

### +2 to +10 Cards

Add the amount shown to the sum of your Number cards.

### x2 Card

Double the points for all your Number cards.

## Calculating Scores

1. **Add** the value of all Number cards
2. **If you have x2**: Multiply that sum by 2
3. **Add** any +N modifier bonuses
4. **If you achieved Flip 7**: Add 15 bonus points

### Example Calculations

- Cards: 3, 11, 5, 7, 10 → Score: 36
- Cards: 3, 11, 5, 7, 10 + x2 → Score: 72
- Cards: 3, 11, 5, 7, 10 + (+10) → Score: 46
- Cards: 3, 11, 5, 7, 10, 9, 4 (Flip 7!) → Score: 49 + 15 = 64

## End of a Round

The round continues until one of two end conditions are met:

1. **No active players remain** - All players have either busted or chosen to stay
2. **Flip 7** - One player flips 7 unique Number cards, ending the round immediately

> To mark yourself as an inactive player, flip your cards over until the round is over.

## Starting the Next Round

1. Set all cards from the round to the side (do NOT shuffle them back into the deck)
2. Pass the remaining cards in the deck to the left - that player becomes the new Dealer
3. When the deck runs out, shuffle all the discarded cards to form a new deck
4. If you need to reshuffle mid-round, leave all cards in front of players where they are (even if that player has busted)

## End of the Game

At the end of the round when at least one player reaches 200 points, the player with the most points wins.

---

*May the cards flip in your favor!*

> **Party of two or less?** Try challenging yourself: can you score 200 points in under 5 rounds?!

> **Playing with more than 18 people?** We recommend playing with a second deck.
